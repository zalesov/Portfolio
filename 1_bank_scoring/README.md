# Borrower reliability research

This project is an example of a task for the credit department of a bank.

Purpose: to establish whether the marital status and the number of children of the client affect the fact of repaying the loan on time. Input data from the bank - statistics on the solvency of customers.

The results of the study will be taken into account when building a **credit scoring** model - a special system that evaluates the ability of a potential borrower to return a loan to a bank.

### During the research it is required to answer the following questions:

- Is there a relationship between the number of children and loan repayment on time?
- Is there a relationship between marital status and loan repayment on time?
- Is there a relationship between the level of income and repayment of the loan on time?
- How do different purposes of the loan affect its repayment on time?

  
Each answer must be accompanied by an explanation.
